            <h2> Phase 0: Requirements Specification</h2>
            <p>Data Flow:</p>
            <p>All of the data comes from the API's online, with the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currnet Location -- FreeGeoIP.app </li>
                <li>Weather information current and future-- OpenWeatherMap</li>
            </ul>
            <p>vue.js is used to post all of the populated data in html. I made a template 
                on indext.html that gives specific id's to the elements that will need to be created, excpet for 
                the 5-day/3-hour forecast. That will be done in a loop, looping thorugh the first 40 elements and making the information as needed.
            </p>

            <p>Plan is to follow the format given in the assignment description, and have a title div, a current location div, a current condition div, and 
                a forecast div that will populate 40 different divs. All of the weather divs will need the date/time, the temperature,
                the high temp, the low temp, the weather description, the % humidity, and the air pressure. All of this data will come from the OpenWeatherMapAPI based on the location. 
            </p>

        </div>



        <div class="orange stuff-box22">
            <h2> Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>
            <p>Will need 3 apps for getting the 3 different API calls, 
                app0 for the location, app1 for the current weather, app2 for the 5 day forecast
            </p>

            <p>A good solution would be the data coming from the fetches in the correct units, and being added to 
                the different vue apps or data and then having it update the user's view.

            </ul>

            <p> The plan is to use the design and functions above, to fectch the URL's in promise chaining,
                and then once the data is recieved add them into the app data before fetching the next URL. Then
                catching errors and if there are errors, displaying them to the screen. Once all the data is in the app, change the done
                elements to true to switch the displayed "Loding..." messages.

            <h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>

            <p>I coded everything and used the developer toools to test how to get information out of the Json objects and it went smoothly. 
                What I had trouble with was figuring out how to get the data from the json object into the apps data, and then I figured out that it 
                was throguh the const vm that mounted the app. It also took me FOREVER to try and get the different colors to toggle. When I switched the 
                state in the dev tools it would work, but the click was not responding at all. After hours of debugging and trying to figure it out, I 
                realized that where I declared forecastToggle, was not properly nested in the app, so it was never being declared. Once that was moved out of the 
                data scope, it worked fine. I ended up changing a lot of my plan, so I went and changed the plan to match my ideas for the code better.

            <p><strong>What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?</strong></p>
            <p>
                I was out of town for a lot of the lecturs, so it took a lot of reading and rewatching lectures to
                understand the flow and the structure of vue. Once that was done it was easier to write. I think if you understand vue,
                it is pretty easy to follow along. 
            </p>
    
            <p><strong>Will your documentation make sense to....
                anybody besides yourself?
                yourself in six month’s time?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, I think it is very self expalnatory.
               </p>
    
            <p><strong>How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?</strong></p>
            <p>Fairly easy, it's just javascript. I also think vue has a lot more complex features that I could use to 
                add more </p>
    
            <p><strong>Will your program continue to work after upgrading
                your computer’s hardware?
                the operating system?
                to the next version of Python?</strong></p> 
                <p>Yes, Yes, and yes, I don't thing javascript is going anywhere
                    anytime soon. It might not work with the next verison of vue, but most
                    likely it will.
